- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Developers with great desires are amateurs and do not sit still. I like to communicate with people and easily find myself in a common language. I take the initiative and am not afraid of illusions. Previous work was in the development of applications for the controller and maintenance of the layers, so in the future there was a desire to participate in the development of applications on a microservice architecture. Since I have no experience in microservices, I am developing in this area, read the books "Spring Microservices in Action", read articles on HabrÃ© and Medium and watch videos on youtube. I also had experience with development on Kotlin
